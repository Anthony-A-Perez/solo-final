# Project Final

I wanted to implement a styling library that I had built using sass so I added new styling to an existing class activities app, "Tech Thoughts".

The original app featured a feed of posts created by login/signup authenticated users whose individual posts can be displayed as a user feed. There are also a comment, remove post, and remove comment features.

The app now has an entirely new appearance built with the custom css library I created using "gulp" sass compiler.

The app also has reduced functionality and a few bugs. The remove comment and remove post features are no longer available and the conditional rendered navigation options in the Header component failed function after deployment. There is also no User feed. To compensate for the failure I've added "logout" and "Go Back" to the Footer component. *The intended rendering for the loggedIn Header will display if the user clicks the title and refreshes the page.
